    <h1 class="header">What is CSS?</h1>
    <p class="p1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage</p>
    <p class="p2">
        With CSS, you can control the color, the size of text, the spaceing between elements, 
        how element are postitioned and laid out, what backround image or backround color are 
        to be used, difference display for diferrent device and screen size, and much more
    </p><br>
    <p class="p3">
        Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent enement will also apply 
        to all children within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue",
        all headings, paragraphs, and other text element within the body will also get the same color
        (unless you specifi something else)!
